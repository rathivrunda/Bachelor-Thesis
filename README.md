This is a project to find the minimum risk portfolio by computing the precision matrix of a large data set. 
The algorithms from "Learning Some Popular Gaussian Graphical Models without Condition Number Bounds, 2020" have been implemented, which claim to minimize amount of observations required and running time
GreedyPrune and HybridMB are the two algorithms, while the rest of the files contain auxillary functions.
